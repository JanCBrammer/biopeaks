	abstract = {Purpose: Heart rate variability is a commonly used measurement to evaluate functioning of autonomic nervous system, psychophysiological stress, and exercise intensity and recovery. {HRV} measurements contain artefacts such as extra, missed or misaligned beat detections, which can produce significant distortion on {HRV} parameters. In this paper, a robust automatic method for artefact detection from {HRV} time series is proposed.
Methods: The proposed detection method is based on time-varying thresholds estimated from distribution of successive {RR}-interval differences combined with a novel beat classification scheme. The method is validated using simulated extra, missed and misaligned beat detections as well as real artefacts such as atrial and ventricular ectopic beats.
Results: The sensitivity of the algorithm to detect simulated missed/extra beats was 100\%. The sensitivity to detect real atrial and ventricular ectopic beats was 96.96\%, the corresponding specificity being 99.94\%. The mean error in {HRV} parameters after correction was {\textless}2\% for missed and extra beats as well as for misaligned beats generated with large displacement factors. Misaligned beats with smallest displacement factor were the most difficult to detect and resulted in largest {HRV} parameter errors after correction, largest errors being {\textless}8\%.
Conclusions: The {HRV} artefact correction algorithm presented in this study provided comparable specificity and better sensitivity to detect ectopic beats as compared to state-of-the-art algorithms. The proposed algorithm detects abnormal beats with high accuracy, is relatively easy to implement, and secures reliable {HRV} analysis by reducing the effect of possible artefacts to tolerable level.},

Even a single artifact may cause unreliable heart rate variability ({HRV}) results. Thus, a robust artifact detection algorithm and the option for manual intervention by the researcher form key components for confident {HRV} analysis. Here, we present {ARTiiFACT}, a software tool for processing electrocardiogram and {IBI} data. Both automated and manual artifact detection and correction are available in a graphical user interface. In addition, {ARTiiFACT} includes time- and frequency-based {HRV} analyses and descriptive statistics, thus offering the basic tools for {HRV} analysis. Notably, all program steps can be executed separately and allow for data export, thus offering high flexibility and interoperability with a whole range of applications.},

	abstract = {The growing technical standard of acquisition systems allows the acquisition of large records, often reaching gigabytes or more in size as is the case with whole-day electroencephalograph ({EEG}) recordings, for example. Although current 64-bit software for signal processing is able to process (e.g. filter, analyze, etc) such data, visual inspection and labeling will probably suffer from rather long latency during the rendering of large portions of recorded signals. For this reason, we have developed {SignalPlant}—a standalone application for signal inspection, labeling and processing. The main motivation was to supply investigators with a tool allowing fast and interactive work with large multichannel records produced by {EEG}, electrocardiograph and similar devices. The rendering latency was compared with {EEGLAB} and proves significantly faster when displaying an image from a large number of samples (e.g. 163-times faster for 75 ×    106 samples). The presented {SignalPlant} software is available free and does not depend on any other computation software. Furthermore, it can be extended with plugins by third parties ensuring its adaptability to future research tasks and new data formats.},
